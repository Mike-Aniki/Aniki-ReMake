### **_This theme focuses on customization and animations._**

With over 25 different interfaces and more than 25 animated login screens, it offers an unmatched level of personalization for your gaming setup.
The goal is to recreate a console-style interface for your PC, especially for controller users.

Each "interface" (I avoid calling them “themes” to avoid confusion with Playnite themes.) lets you fully change the look, similar to how the PS4 offered multiple theme options.

Due to the rich graphics and animations, this theme may not be perfectly smooth on lower-end PCs. 
However, even on modest setups, it still offers a fun, customizable experience that makes the interface unique to each user.

---

### **_This theme supports the following plugins :_**

Theme Options, SuccessStory, BackToGame, BackgroundChanger, CheckDLC, Screenshot Visualizer.

---

### **_Please follow these instructions before using a theme:_**

First, make sure you've installed the following add-ons for an optimal theme experience. These add-ons enhance the look and feel of your Playnite setup, and some are essential for full functionality.

To download them :

1. Open **Playnite** in desktop mode.
2. Click on the **Playnite icon** (controller-shaped) at the top left to access the settings.
3. Select **Add-ons**, then go to the **Browse** tab at the bottom.
4. Search for and install the following add-ons:

Required : 

>- **Theme Options** _(Customizes the theme, thanks to Artem Shpynov)_
>- **ExtraMetadataLoader** _(Displays game trailers and logos)._
>- **ExtraMetadataLoader Fullscreen Helper** _(Ensures ExtraMetadata works in fullscreen mode)._

Optional :

>- **SuccessStory** _(Shows in-game achievements)._
>- **PlayniteSound Mod** by Artem Shpynov _(Plays different music for each game and manages audio during trailers and intros. Make sure you install the "Mod" version of this extension)._

>- **BackgroundChanger** _(Allows you to set multiple backgrounds per game)._
>- **CheckDLC** _(To see the dlc of games and those owned)._
>- **Screenshot Visualizer** _(To see your screenshot of games)._

Metadata Source:

>- **Universal PSN Metadata** _(To automatically download game covers in square format
     			and wallpapers adapted to the theme with characters on the right of the screen)._

---

### **To modify the theme:**

To change aspects like the theme color, avatar, and username, you'll need the **Theme Options** add-on. This allows for easy customization without manually editing theme files. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Download and install the [**Theme Options** add-on](https://github.com/ashpynov/ThemeOptions) by Artem Shpynov.
2. Once installed, you can customize the theme through the **Theme Options** interface in the Playnite settings.

_A big thanks to Artem Shpynov for his incredible work on this add-on!_

### **Customize filter icons:**

Icons allow you to visually differentiate between various filters like "My Games" or "Favorites." Here’s how you can change them:

>- Open the Theme folder, and navigate to **[Icons\Filter]**.
>- To access the theme folder: In desktop mode, click on the Playnite icon at the top left, go to **Add-ons**, and find the **Full Screen** tab under installed extensions. Click **Installation folder**.
>- Add or replace any `.png` files with your own icons, then rename them to match your filters (e.g., "My Games.png" for the "My Games" filter).

---

### **Customize source icons:**

Source icons represent platforms like Steam or Epic Games. Here's how to update them:

>- Open the Theme folder and go to **[Icons\Source]**.
>- Access the folder as described above.
>- Add or replace the source icons (e.g., use "Steam.png" for Steam).

---

### **Modify navigation audio files:**

You can replace or disable the navigation sounds for a more personalized experience:

>- Open the Theme folder, and navigate to **[Audio]**.
>- Replace existing audio files by renaming your files to match, or delete them to remove the sounds entirely.

---

### **Modify Status on Game Cover:**

>- In desktop mode, click on playnite's icone in the top left-hand corner, then on library/Lybrary Manager (or with CTRL+W).
>- In the list that appears, choose "completion statuses".
>- Here you can add or modify game statuses; if you don't want to display any statuses, simply delete all the statuses.
>- I advise you to create your own status, then you can modify the status of a game from fullscreen.

# **Recommended Settings**

### **In Desktop Mode:**

### **For wallpapers and covers:**

I recommend using square covers for games, combined with PlayStation Network (PSN) metadata. PlayStation screen backgrounds often place characters on the right, and this theme is designed around that layout.

Here’s how to set it up:

>- Open **Settings** from the Playnite icon at the top left.
>- Go to the **Metadata** tab and select **PSN Store** for both the **Cover** and **Background Image** options.
>- If you use multiple metadata sources, ensure PSN is at the top to prioritize it.


### **Convert game covers to square format:**

>- Go to **Settings > Appearance > Grid View**.
>- Set the **Target Aspect Ratio** to **1:1** for square covers.


### **Update metadata for all games:**

If you want to update all existing games with new metadata:

>- Open the Playnite menu and go to **Library > Download Metadata** (or use **CTRL+D**).
>- In the window that appears, select **All Games From Database** and uncheck **Only Missing Metadata**.
>- Click **Next**, and follow the prompts to download metadata from your chosen sources.

---

### **For logos:**

Logos are an important part of the theme design. To set them up correctly:

>- Go to **Add-ons > Generic > Extra Metadata Loader > Logo Settings**.
>- Set the maximum width to **600** and the maximum height to **320**.

### How to download logos :

>- On Playnite desktop mode, select the games you want to download videos for via standard ways (Single right click, Ctrl+Click, Ctrl+A, Shift+Click), right click and select the menu item as shown in the image below.
>- Follow the instructions and wait for the logo to download.

### **For trailers:**


### Setup ExtraMetadata Loader

>- On Playnite Desktop Mode, go to the extension settings page. It is located in MainMenu -> Add-ons... -> Extensions settings -> Generic -> Extra Metadata Loader.
>- Download the required files by clicking the buttons in the screenshot. The numbers indicate which button you have to click to download the file that contains the required file.
>- Extract the files in any location and click the "Browse..." buttons of each of the required files and select the file it asks you.

### How to download trailers :

</p>


### **Mute game trailers by default:**

To automatically mute trailers:

>- In desktop mode, go to **Add-ons > Extra Metadata Loader > Video Settings** and tick **Play videos initially without sound**.


### **Ensure the trailer button works smoothly:**

>- In **Add-ons > Extra Metadata Loader > Video settings**, uncheck **Show video preview when video is not playing** to prevent playback issues.
