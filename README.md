The Ultimate Console-Like Experience for Playnite
</h1>
</div>

With 25+ customizable interfaces and 25+ animated login screens, Aniki Remake offers an unmatched level of personalization for a Fullscreen Playnite theme

### **A True Console Interface for PC**

Designed especially for controller users, this theme transforms your Playnite into an experience similar to modern consoles. Each interface (not "theme" to avoid confusion with Playnite themes) allows you to completely change the look, just like customizable themes on the PS4.

### **Advanced and Unique Customization**

Customize everything, choose cover shapes, enable/disable platform banners, show/hide trailers, browse trophies, view screenshots & videos, check Steam DLCs, and much more !

# **Customizations**

### **Changing Theme Colors, Avatars, and Usernames**
To change aspects like the theme color, avatar, and username, you'll need the Theme Options add-on. This allows for easy customization without manually editing theme files. Follow these steps to get started:
>- Install the **Theme Options** add-on.  
>- Navigate to Playnite settings > **Theme Options** to access customization settings.

</p>

---

### **Filter Icons**:
Icons allow you to visually differentiate between various filters like "My Games" or "Favorites." Here’s how you can change them :
>- Go to the theme folder: **Icons/Filter**.
>- Replace `.png` files with your custom icons.  
>- Match the file names to the filters (e.g., `My Games.png`).

</p>

---

### **Source Icons**:
Source icons represent platforms like Steam or Epic Games. Here's how to update them:
>- Navigate to **Icons/Source** in the theme folder.  
>- Replace platform icons (e.g., `Steam.png`) with custom images.
<p align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/Mike-Aniki/Aniki-ReMake/blob/main/Images/Sourcesetting.png?raw=true" alt="Source icons" width="40%" />
</p>

---

### **Avatars**
To changing Avatars for your own, you need to use images in ".PNG" format :
>- Open the theme folder: **Themes Option/3.Avatar Folder**.  
>- Replace .png files with your own .png files (you'll need to rename your images with exactly the same name to match the avatar you want to replace).

---

### **Navigation Sounds**
You can replace or disable the navigation sounds for a more personalized experience :
>- Open the theme folder: **Audio**.  
>- Replace existing audio files by renaming your files to match, or delete them to remove the sounds entirely.

---

### **Login Screen Background Music**
You can replace or disable background music on login screen :
>- Open the Theme folder, and navigate to **Audio**.  
>- Rename your **.mp3** file **“AcceuilOST”** and replace the **AcceuilOST.mp3** file in the folder, or delete it to remove the music completely.

---

### **Game Status Customization**  
>- In desktop mode, click on playnite's icone in the top left-hand corner, then on library/Lybrary Manager (or with CTRL+W).  
>- In the list that appears, choose "completion statuses".
>- Here you can add or modify game statuses; if you don't want to display any statuses, simply delete all the statuses.
>- I advise you to create your own status, then you can modify the status of a game from fullscreen.

---

### **Platform Banners**  
The banners for the platforms are based on the source and the platform configured for a game. The display priority is as follows: first, it looks for a .png file for the source. If no .png is found, it will display the platform banner instead.

The linking is done using only the first source/platform listed. In other words, if a game has multiple platforms, only the first one in the list will be taken into account.

As for the source and filter icons, the platform must match the name used by the .png. le dossier des bannieres ce trouve : **ThemeFolder/Icons/Banner**

### **For wallpapers and covers:**

I recommend using square covers for games, combined with PlayStation Network (PSN) metadata. PlayStation screen backgrounds often place characters on the right, and this theme is designed around that layout.

Here’s how to set it up:

**In Desktop Mode:**

>- Open **Settings** from the Playnite icon at the top left.
>- Go to the **Metadata** tab and select **PSN Store** for both the **Cover** and **Background Image** options.
>- If you use multiple metadata sources, ensure PSN is at the top to prioritize it.

	<img align="top" src="https://github.com/Mike-Aniki/Aniki-ReMake/blob/main/Images/SettingMetadata.png?raw=true" alt="Sublime's custom image" width="40%" />	
</p>

**Convert game covers to square format:**

>- Go to **Settings > Appearance > Grid View**.
>- Set the **Target Aspect Ratio** to **1:1** for square covers.

	<img align="top" src="https://github.com/Mike-Aniki/Aniki-ReMake/blob/main/Images/SquareCover.png?raw=true" alt="Sublime's custom image" width="40%" />	
</p>


**Update metadata for all games:**

If you want to update all existing games with new metadata:

>- Open the Playnite menu and go to **Library > Download Metadata** (or use **CTRL+D**).
>- In the window that appears, select **All Games From Database** and uncheck **Only Missing Metadata**.
>- Click **Next**, and follow the prompts to download metadata from your chosen sources.

</p>

### **For logos:**

Logos are an important part of the theme design. To set them up correctly:

>- Go to **Add-ons > Generic > Extra Metadata Loader > Logo Settings**.
>- Set the maximum width to **600** and the maximum height to **320**.
>- Check option "Download logos of newly added games on library update".

<p align="Center">
	<img align="top" src="https://github.com/Mike-Aniki/Aniki-ReMake/blob/main/Images/SettingLogo.png?raw=true" alt="Sublime's custom image" width="40%" />
</p>

Note: To ensure that game logos work, you will need the ExtraMetadata Loader add-on.

**How to download logos :**

>- On Playnite desktop mode, select the games you want to download videos for via standard ways (Single right click, Ctrl+Click, Ctrl+A, Shift+Click), right click and select the menu item as shown in the image below.
>- Follow the instructions and wait for the logo to download.

</p>

### **For trailers:**
**Setup ExtraMetadata Loader**

>- On Playnite Desktop Mode, go to the extension settings page. It is located in MainMenu -> Add-ons... -> Extensions settings -> Generic -> Extra Metadata Loader.
>- Download the required files by clicking the buttons in the screenshot. The numbers indicate which button you have to click to download the file that contains the required file.
>- Extract the files in any location and click the "Browse..." buttons of each of the required files and select the file it asks you.

</p>


**Mute game trailers by default:**

To automatically mute trailers:

>- In desktop mode, go to **Add-ons > Extra Metadata Loader > Video Settings** and tick **Play videos initially without sound**.


**Ensure the trailer button works smoothly:**

>- In **Add-ons > Extra Metadata Loader > Video settings**, uncheck **Show video preview when video is not playing** to prevent playback issues.

**Important Settings for the Theme**  

Disable the “Pause music during video trailer” option in the plugin settings to avoid conflicts.

# **Add-ons configuration**

### **Playnite Sounds Mod:**

 _If you want to integrate game music into the theme, it’s essential to download "Playnite Sound Mod" instead of "Playnite Sound".
 Playnite Sound Mod by Artem Shpynov has replaced the older version with many improvements :_

>- YouTube search integration: You can now search for and download music directly from YouTube.
>- Music preview: Listen to music before downloading to make sure it’s what you want.
>- Batch downloading: No need to download music tracks one by one; you can download them in batches.
>- Automatic pause control: Music will automatically pause if a video, like a trailer, starts playing.
>- Additional advanced features for a much smoother and more enjoyable user experience.

**Important Setting for Using Playnite Sound Mod with Aniki Remake**

For Playnite Sound Mod to work perfectly with my theme, you need to disable the “Pause music during video trailer” option in the plugin settings. When enabled, this option can mistake certain videos, such as intros and background videos, as trailers and mute the music. My theme already uses its own triggers to handle music pausing, so this plugin setting is unnecessary and can cause conflicts.

Instructions :

>- Go to the settings for Playnite Sound Mod.
>- Disable the option “Pause music during video trailer.”

**How to Install FFMPEG NORMALIZE For PlayniteSoundsMod**

_This automatically adjusts the sound level of the music to the same level for all song, to avoid one tune being too low and the next too high._

>- Install the latest python release from python.org
>- Open the Python installation folder and open "Scripts" folder (default path is C:\User\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts).
>- In the file explorer address bar, type "PowerShell".
>- In the window that opens, type ".\pip3 install ffmpeg-normalize" This will install ffmpeg_normalizer.exe in this folder.
>- Now in Playnite, PlayniteSoundMod Settings enter the path to ffmpeg-normalize.exe.
>- Check "Automatically normalize music when downloading".
>- Your ears will thank you

### **ScreenshotsVisualizer:**

 _Configure Screenshot Folders :_

>- In the plugin settings, click on the small buttons (1) to let the plugin automatically configure the screenshot folders for each launcher.
>- In Global screenshot path (2), specify the folder on your PC where your manual screenshots are stored. By adding {Name} at the end of the path, the plugin will search for folders named after each game.
>- You can also add multiple folders for a single game. Press the Add button (3) to open a window with a list of your games in Playnite.
>- Select your game, and it will appear in the main window. Then, click on Add Folder (4) as many times as needed and enter the path for each folder.
