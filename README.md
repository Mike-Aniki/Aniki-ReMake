<h1 align="center">ANIKI REMAKE : FULLSCREEN THEME FOR PLAYNITE</h1>
</div>



<div align="center">


### **_This theme focuses on customization and animations._**

With over 25 different interfaces and more than 25 animated login screens, it offers an unmatched level of personalization for your gaming setup.
The goal is to recreate a console-style interface for your PC, especially for controller users.

Each "interface" (I avoid calling them “themes” to avoid confusion with Playnite themes.) lets you fully change the look, similar to how the PS4 offered multiple theme options.

Due to the rich graphics and animations, this theme may not be perfectly smooth on lower-end PCs. 
However, even on modest setups, it still offers a fun, customizable experience that makes the interface unique to each user.

⚠️ **_Warning_**

For users still on a version earlier than 1.5.8, it is essential to uninstall and reinstall the theme.
Versions prior to 1.5.8 had an issue that prevented theme updates through Playnite from working correctly.

This issue has been fixed since version 1.5.8, but many users still appear to be using older versions. To ensure proper updates:

Check your current theme version.
If it’s older than 1.5.8:
- Uninstall the theme.
- Reinstall it to ensure future updates apply correctly.

---

### **_For the theme to work correctly and without bugs, please set the number of columns to 9 or 10, and the spacing between elements to Minimum 30. This will allow the entire theme to be displayed correctly._**

Icons allow you to visually differentiate between various filters like "My Games" or "Favorites." Here’s how you can change them:

>- Open the Theme folder, and navigate to **[Icons\Filter]**.
>- To access the theme folder: In desktop mode, click on the Playnite icon at the top left, go to **Add-ons**, and find the **Full Screen** tab under installed extensions. Click **Installation folder**.
>- Add or replace any `.png` files with your own icons, then rename them to match your filters (e.g., "My Games.png" for the "My Games" filter).

Source icons represent platforms like Steam or Epic Games. Here's how to update them:

</p>

---

### **Changing Avatars for your own:**

To do this, you need to use images in ".PNG" format.

>- Open the Theme folder and go to [Themes Option\3.Avatar folder].
>- Replace .png files with your own .png files (you'll need to rename your images with exactly the same name to match the avatar you want to replace).

---

### **Modify navigation audio files:**

You can replace or disable the navigation sounds for a more personalized experience:

>- Open the Theme folder, and navigate to **[Audio]**.
>- Replace existing audio files by renaming your files to match, or delete them to remove the sounds entirely.

---

### **Modify background music on login screen:**

You can replace or disable background music on login screen :

>- Open the Theme folder, and navigate to **[Audio]**.
>- Rename your .mp3 file “AcceuilOST” and replace the “AcceuilOST.mp3” file in the folder, or delete it to remove the music completely.

---

### **Modify Status on Game Cover:**

>- In desktop mode, click on playnite's icone in the top left-hand corner, then on library/Lybrary Manager (or with CTRL+W).
>- In the list that appears, choose "completion statuses".
>- Here you can add or modify game statuses; if you don't want to display any statuses, simply delete all the statuses.
>- I advise you to create your own status, then you can modify the status of a game from fullscreen.

---

### **Platforms Banner on Game Cover:**

>- Platform banners are linked to the first platform listed in the game's properties. If multiple platforms are specified, only the first one will be considered. 

---

### **Playnite Sounds Mod :**

 _If you want to integrate game music into the theme, it’s essential to download "Playnite Sound Mod" instead of "Playnite Sound".
 Playnite Sound Mod by Artem Shpynov has replaced the older version with many improvements :_

>- YouTube search integration: You can now search for and download music directly from YouTube.
>- Music preview: Listen to music before downloading to make sure it’s what you want.
>- Batch downloading: No need to download music tracks one by one; you can download them in batches.
>- Automatic pause control: Music will automatically pause if a video, like a trailer, starts playing.
>- Additional advanced features for a much smoother and more enjoyable user experience.

**Important Setting for Using Playnite Sound Mod with Aniki Remake**

For Playnite Sound Mod to work perfectly with my theme, you need to disable the “Pause music during video trailer” option in the plugin settings. When enabled, this option can mistake certain videos, such as intros and background videos, as trailers and mute the music. My theme already uses its own triggers to handle music pausing, so this plugin setting is unnecessary and can cause conflicts.

Instructions :

>- Go to the settings for Playnite Sound Mod.
>- Disable the option “Pause music during video trailer.”

**How to Install FFMPEG NORMALIZE For PlayniteSoundsMod**

_This automatically adjusts the sound level of the music to the same level for all song, to avoid one tune being too low and the next too high._

>- Install the latest python release from python.org
>- Open the Python installation folder and open "Scripts" folder (default path is C:\User\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts).
>- In the file explorer address bar, type "PowerShell".
>- In the window that opens, type ".\pip3 install ffmpeg-normalize" This will install ffmpeg_normalizer.exe in this folder.
>- Now in Playnite, PlayniteSoundMod Settings enter the path to ffmpeg-normalize.exe.
>- Check "Automatically normalize music when downloading".
>- Your ears will thank you

### **ScreenshotsVisualizer :**

 _Configure Screenshot Folders :_

>- In the plugin settings, click on the small buttons (1) to let the plugin automatically configure the screenshot folders for each launcher.
>- In Global screenshot path (2), specify the folder on your PC where your manual screenshots are stored. By adding {Name} at the end of the path, the plugin will search for folders named after each game.
>- You can also add multiple folders for a single game. Press the Add button (3) to open a window with a list of your games in Playnite.
>- Select your game, and it will appear in the main window. Then, click on Add Folder (4) as many times as needed and enter the path for each folder.

# **Recommended Settings**

### **In Desktop Mode:**

### **For wallpapers and covers:**

I recommend using square covers for games, combined with PlayStation Network (PSN) metadata. PlayStation screen backgrounds often place characters on the right, and this theme is designed around that layout.

Here’s how to set it up:

>- Open **Settings** from the Playnite icon at the top left.
>- Go to the **Metadata** tab and select **PSN Store** for both the **Cover** and **Background Image** options.
>- If you use multiple metadata sources, ensure PSN is at the top to prioritize it.

	<img align="top" src="https://github.com/Mike-Aniki/Aniki-ReMake/blob/main/Images/SettingMetadata.png?raw=true" alt="Sublime's custom image" width="40%" />	
</p>

### **Convert game covers to square format:**

>- Go to **Settings > Appearance > Grid View**.
>- Set the **Target Aspect Ratio** to **1:1** for square covers.

<p align="Center">
	<img align="top" src="https://github.com/Mike-Aniki/Aniki-ReMake/blob/main/Images/SquareCover.png?raw=true" alt="Sublime's custom image" width="40%" />	
</p>


### **Update metadata for all games:**

If you want to update all existing games with new metadata:

>- Open the Playnite menu and go to **Library > Download Metadata** (or use **CTRL+D**).
>- In the window that appears, select **All Games From Database** and uncheck **Only Missing Metadata**.
>- Click **Next**, and follow the prompts to download metadata from your chosen sources.

</p>

### **For logos:**

Logos are an important part of the theme design. To set them up correctly:

>- Go to **Add-ons > Generic > Extra Metadata Loader > Logo Settings**.
>- Set the maximum width to **600** and the maximum height to **320**.
>- Check option "Download logos of newly added games on library update".

</p>

### How to download logos :

>- On Playnite desktop mode, select the games you want to download videos for via standard ways (Single right click, Ctrl+Click, Ctrl+A, Shift+Click), right click and select the menu item as shown in the image below.
>- Follow the instructions and wait for the logo to download.

### **For trailers:**


### Setup ExtraMetadata Loader

>- On Playnite Desktop Mode, go to the extension settings page. It is located in MainMenu -> Add-ons... -> Extensions settings -> Generic -> Extra Metadata Loader.
>- Download the required files by clicking the buttons in the screenshot. The numbers indicate which button you have to click to download the file that contains the required file.
>- Extract the files in any location and click the "Browse..." buttons of each of the required files and select the file it asks you.

### **Mute game trailers by default:**

To automatically mute trailers:

>- In desktop mode, go to **Add-ons > Extra Metadata Loader > Video Settings** and tick **Play videos initially without sound**.


### **Ensure the trailer button works smoothly:**

>- In **Add-ons > Extra Metadata Loader > Video settings**, uncheck **Show video preview when video is not playing** to prevent playback issues.
